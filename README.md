# PCode Academy

## Introduction
In the PCode Academy you can level up your (develop) skills to get an expert in every domain we provide.

## How it works

### Choose a module
The PCode Academy is seperated in different domains. One domain for example could be React. A domain is then again seperated in specific modules like react-beginner or react-redux. 

### Module readme
If you have choosen a module you will find a readme.md in there. The readme.md is seperated in:

* Course
* Comments
* PCode Clean Code Adventure

#### Course
This is simply a link to the course we had choosen for this module.

#### Comments
Our comments to the course like if we do something different than the course intructor or we want to add something.

#### PCode Clean Code Adventure
For some modules we had set up a piece of code with unit tests. It is not a test like in the school but it should help you to understand the module you want to learn better. It is more like a discussion because you fulfill the tests and then you will make a pull request to our [repository](https://github.com/pcode-at/clean-code-adventure). Then we discuss together your code in form of a code review.
