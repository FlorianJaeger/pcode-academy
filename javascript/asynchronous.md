# Asynchronous code
JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language. Considering this it is very important that you understand the behavior of asynchronous code.
There are three important techniques for writing asynchronous code in JavaScript:
* Callbacks
* Promises
* Async / Await

For understanding asynchronous JavaScript in general read this [article](https://blog.bitsrc.io/understanding-asynchronous-javascript-the-event-loop-74cd408419ff).

### Callbacks
A callback is a function that is to be executed after another function has finished executing. Read this [article](A callback is a function that is to be executed after another function has finished executing).

### Promises
For understanding promises read this [article](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-a-promise-27fc71e77261).

### Async / Await
This [article](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/avoiding-the-async-await-hell-c77a0fb71c4c) points out the correct usage of async/await and how you can avoid common pitfalls.
