# Closures
A [closure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures) is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared.

## Resources
I strongly recommend reading the article [I never understood JavaScript closures](https://medium.com/dailyjs/i-never-understood-javascript-closures-9663703368e8). It explains closures very nicely. If you want to read more there is also the article [Master the JavaScript Interview: What is a Closure?](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-a-closure-b2f0d2152b36) from Eric Elliott.
