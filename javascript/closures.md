## Resources
I strongly recommend reading this [article](https://medium.com/dailyjs/i-never-understood-javascript-closures-9663703368e8). It explains closures very nicely. If you want to read more there is also this [article](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-a-closure-b2f0d2152b36) from Eric Elliott.
