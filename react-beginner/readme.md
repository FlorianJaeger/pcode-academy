### Video #13
This video is all about data handling and the state of components in React. It is important that you understand the unidirectional data flow and the problems that came with it. In this [article](https://medium.com/dailyjs/when-do-i-know-im-ready-for-redux-f34da253c85f) you will get a nice, visual explanation and a glimpse into the state-management library [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).

Here you will see how you can update the state. The course instructor also mentions the word 'immutable'. It is important that when you update the state you follow these [immutable update patterns](https://redux.js.org/recipes/structuring-reducers/immutable-update-patterns). In this [article](https://wecodetheweb.com/2016/02/12/immutable-javascript-using-es6-and-beyond/) you will learn more about why writing immutable JavaScript code is a good practice.
